Homology Search Results (BLASTp)
__________________________________

A BLAST search was conducted programmatically using Biopython, specifically the Bio.Blast.NCBIWWW module. 
The resulting output was generated in XML format and subsequently used for downstream functional annotation.

Top BLAST Hit:
Protein Name: (S)-ureidoglycine aminohydrolase
Sequence Length: 261 amino acids

Interpretation:
The BLASTp analysis reveals strong homology between the query sequence and a characterized enzyme. 
This high degree of sequence similarity suggests that the protein likely shares a conserved biological function.
